# token

Really (really) basic text processing: 
 OpenNLP tokenization -> de-punc -> downcase -> stoplist

This code uses the OpenNLP tokenization model and a reasonable English
stoplist from the Journal of Machine Learning Research (JMLR).

## Usage

After fetching the tokenization model and stoplist with
resources/getmodels.sh, processing text should be pretty easy

(with-token 
 (doseq [tok (process-text "Boo far Baz said the the (catdog)")]
   (println tok)))
